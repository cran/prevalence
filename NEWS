prevalence 0.3.0
================

* new function `truePrevMulti2`, implementing a covariance scheme for
  estimating TP from AP obtained with multiple tests

* new function `define_prior2` to show the definition of the priors used
  by `truePrevMulti2`

* definition of `x` in `truePrevMulti` is reversed; first element of `x` now
  is the number of samples positive on all tests, last element of `x` is the
  number of samples negative on all tests

* 'definition' functions renamed to `define_x` and `define_prior`

* functions `truePrev` and `truePrevPools` lost args `conf.level` and `plot`

* function `betaPERT` lost args `p` and `plot`

* print method for objects of class `prev` no longer shows percentages

* various code cleanups and small bug and typo fixes
